# Network Media Types
Data is transmitted across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination via Ellectrical/light pulses or Electromagnetic waves


## Common Network Cables 

- Twisted-Pair Cable
    Ethernet technology generally uses twisted-pair cables to interconnect devices.

    In twisted-pair, wires are grouped in pairs and twisted together to reduce interference. The pairs of wires are colored so that you can identify the same wire at each end. Typically, in each pair, one of the wires is a solid color and its partner is the same color striped onto a white background.

- Coaxial Cable

    Coaxial was one of the earliest types of network cabling developed. It is also used for connecting the various components which make up satellite communication systems. Coaxial cable has a single rigid copper core that conducts the signal. This core is typically surrounded by a layer of insulation, braided metal shielding, and a protective jacket. It is used as a high-frequency transmission line to carry high-frequency or broadband signals.

- Fiber-Optic Cable

    Glass or plastic.
    They have a very high bandwidth, which enables them to carry very large amounts of data. Fiber is used in backbone networks, large enterprise environments, and large data centers. It is also used extensively by telephone companies.
