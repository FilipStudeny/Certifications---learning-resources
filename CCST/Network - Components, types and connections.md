# NETWORK COMPONENTS, TYPES AND CONNECTIONS

## CLIENTS AND SERVERS

### Client and Server Roles
- All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.

- Hosts can send and receive messages on the network.
- Hosts can serve as Client, Server or Both.

### Peer-to-Peer Networks
- One computer can be both Server and Client at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many PCs function as the servers and clients on the network => **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network**

- The simplest type of **P2P** Network consists of two connected computers using either a wired or wireless connection.

- Multiple PCs can be connected to form larger P2P Network using **Switches**

- Main disadvantage of P2P is the performance of a host can be slowed down if it is acting as both a client and server at the same time.

The advantages of peer-to-peer networking:

    - Easy to set up
    - Less complex
    - Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
    - Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

The disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking:

    - No centralized administration
    - Not as secure
    - Not scalable
    - All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance

### Peer-to-Peer Applications
A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication. In this model, every client is a server and every server is a client. P2P applications require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service.

Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory. In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.

### Multiple Roles in the Network
A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to one or many clients.
